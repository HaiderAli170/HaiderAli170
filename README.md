👋 Hi, I’m @HaiderAli170
<a href="https://app.daily.dev/haiderali54"><img src="https://api.daily.dev/devcards/v2/SagjFvsF0T4ZAhWN18jMv.png?type=wide&r=fw8" width="652" alt="Haider Ali's Dev Card"/></a>

👀 I’m interested in web development, with a particular focus on building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. I have a passion for working with React and JavaScript, and I'm currently exploring the powerful combination of React with TypeScript to create more robust and type-safe applications.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced patterns in React, diving deeper into TypeScript to leverage its full potential in my projects, and exploring the latest features in ECMAScript to keep my JavaScript knowledge up to date. I'm also interested in learning about state management libraries and how they can be optimally used with React.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to React and TypeScript. I'm keen on contributing to libraries or frameworks that enhance the developer experience or offer new ways to solve common problems in web development.
